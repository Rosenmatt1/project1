                    <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.</p>

                    <p>It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.</p>
